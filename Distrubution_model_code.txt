#data variables:
#Nobs: number of observations of root biomass
#r.bio: root biomass observation at each depth
#r.tot: total root biomass in the profile (sum of r.bio for each loc and sample depth)
#Day index for sample period varies by root biomass observations
#depth: relative depth in the active layer for each root biomass observation
#Nday: number of sample periods
